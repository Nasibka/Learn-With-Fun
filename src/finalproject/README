Introduction
Technology is an essential part of our lives today and few can imagine living without. The
effective u se of Technology in Education has changed the face of education and it has created
more educational opportunities. Both teachers and students have benefited from various
educational technologies , teachers have learned how to integrate technology in their classrooms
and students are getting more interested in learning with technology . The use of technology in
education has removed educational boundaries , both students and teachers can collaborate in real
time using advanced educational technologies .

Motivation
Nowadays gamification of educational process is one of the most interesting topics. And I
decided to dedicate my final project with this topic, because, I believe that it will be very useful
and interesting.
Gamification shows students that learning can be more interactive, they can receive rewards to
give value to their work and that formal and informal educational settings can combine for great
results.
